# package-cloudflare

This repository contains modules for deploying and managing Cloudflare infrastructure such DNS zones and records as well
as configuring security, caching, and custom rule configuration. This repository also contains modules for Cloudflare
user and account management.


## Using a Terraform Module

To use a module in your Terraform templates, create a `module` resource and set its `source` field to the Git URL of
this repo. You should also set the `ref` parameter so you're fixed to a specific version of this repo, as the `master`
branch may have backwards incompatible changes (see [module sources](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/sources.html)).

For example, to use `1.0.0` of the `azure-function-app` module, you would add the following:

```hcl
module "cloudflare_zone" {
  source = "git::git@github.com:quantum-sec/package-cloudflare.git//modules/cloudflare-zone?ref=1.0.0"

  // set the parameters for the cloudflare-zone module
}
```

_Note: the double slash (`//`) is intentional and required. It's part of Terraform's Git syntax (see [module sources](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/sources.html))._

See the module's documentation and `vars.tf` file for all the parameters you can set. Run `terraform get -update` to
pull the latest version of this module from this repo before running the standard  `terraform plan` and
`terraform apply` commands.


## Using Scripts & Binaries

You can install the scripts and binaries in the `modules` folder of any repo using the [Gruntwork Installer](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork-installer).
For example, if the scripts you want to install are in the `modules/ecs-scripts` folder of the
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-ecs repo, you could install them as follows:

```bash
gruntwork-install --module-name "ecs-scripts" --repo "https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-ecs" --tag "0.0.1"
```

See the docs for each script & binary for detailed instructions on how to use them.
